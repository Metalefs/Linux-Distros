The Debian Project is one of the oldest distributions, dating back to 1993, and is currently the largest volunteer-based distribution provider. Debian, the "universal operating system", has been translated into many languages; works on many hardware platforms; has a large repository with a wide variety of packages; includes experimental kernel variants for kfreebsd and the GNU Hurd; and has many derivatives. Debian Stable releases when ready, not on any fixed schedule, but stable releases happen about every two years and are supported for about 3 years. The LTS team provides commercial support for old-stable releases with security updates for a reduced set of packages after the Debian security team ends official support. The Debian testing branch (currently 11.0 "bullseye") is where the next stable release is prepared; packages are more current than stable while (usually) providing a stable desktop. The unstable branch (sid) is more bleeding edge, while the experimental branch contains packages that aren''t yet ready for sid. Debian 12 will be named "bookworm" and Debian 13 "trixie". Debian 9.0 "stretch" was released June 17, 2017. The 13th and final stretch point release, Debian 9.13, was released July 18, 2020. The LTS team will take over maintenance of "stretch".

Unlike a standard linux install, Porteus exists in a compressed state on the portable drive. It has no /root /bin /etc file structure on the portable device itself, rather this is created on the fly during the boot process, which only takes around 20-30 seconds on a relatively new computer. It is modular in design which means extra software comes in the form of ''modules'' which can be activated and injected into the live file system. It does not need to be installed and uninstalled as you may expect with other operating systems which takes numerous amounts of clicks and agreements.
